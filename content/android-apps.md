Below is an assortment of Android apps that I find well made: responsive with pleasant interfaces and no advertisements.

* [2FAS](https://2fas.com/) - store, sync, and use your TOTP tokens
* [FitNotes](https://www.fitnotesapp.com/) - workout tracking
* [MBCompass](https://github.com/CompassMB/MBCompass)
