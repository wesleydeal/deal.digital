## Me

I am technology enthusiast, systems administrator, and recovering glutton.

## This site

is published through [GitHub](https://github.com/wesleydeal/deal.digital) using the
[Zola](https://getzola.org) static site generator. It uses the Red Hat Text, Display,
and Mono typefaces.

### Design goals

* keep page resources <512kB
* use semantic and readable HTML where possible
* maximize readability
* minimize scripts & external resources
* act as a 'hub site', engaging in a bit of [hypertext maximalism](https://libre.town/thoughts/entry_9.xhtml)
