        <h1>ThinkPad T420 BIOS Mod with downgrade support for 1.48+</h1>
		<p class="meta">Updated 2018-02-08. Written by sdx1, adapted from <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Custom_BIOS">thinkwiki.org/wiki/Custom_BIOS</a>. Originally published 2017-12-09.</p>
        <p>The ThinkPad T420 and other xx20 laptops have long suffered from a crippling bug that causes 100% CPU usage when an eGPU and 16GB of RAM are installed simultaneously. This most likely stems from a lack of support in BIOS for 1600 and 1866 MHz memory modules. Lenovo has never bothered to release a patch, but Oleh and later <a href="https://www.bios-mods.com/forum/Thread-REQUEST-Whitelist-Lenovo-T420-BIOS-v-1-22-83uj05us?page=2">BDMaster from BIOS-Mods released a custom BIOS fixing the issue</a>. For ease of access, I've uploaded his BIOS here, along with a nicer BIOS logo and a method to downgrade from versions 1.48 and 1.49.</p>
