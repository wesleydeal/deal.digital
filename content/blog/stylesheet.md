I'm certainly not a designer by trade or training; I don't know the words, the principles, the tricks of the trade.
But I find myself constantly fascinated by choices of shape, spacing, contrast, and type, both in print and
on screen. I'm particularly enthralled with [pre-2010s computer interfaces](http://toastytech.com/guis/index.html) and [themes](https://macthemes.garden/).
As graphical computing developed, there was such a diversity of design and interface paradigms. Low resolution
and color depth created tight constraints for designers, and with them beautiful artifacts such as dither patterns,
bitmap fonts, and almost-but-not-quite analogues of real world objects. Because the field was new, they were free to
experiment with different UX patterns.

Not all were successful, of course, and I'm under no illusion
