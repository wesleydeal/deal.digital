	   - an inline list of H1 links, sticky at the top of the screen
	   - automatically highlight the first one on the screen if JS is enabled
	   - @media (pointer: course) - allow horizontal scrolling with scroll snapping if this list rather than wrapping, see [example](https://iamsteve.me/blog/horizontal-scrolling-responsive-menu)
