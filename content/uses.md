* 💻 ThinkPad Z13 (AMD 6850U, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 x [Fedora 40 KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/))
* 🧭 [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) to Win+Drag move, resize windows
* 🗒️ [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) depending on my mood.  
  * Yes, these all run on Windows as well.
  * I haven't quite decided if [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is worth learning the muscle memory for, but I like it as well.
* 🌍 Brave Browser, although I'm considering a move to Firefox if the devs don't fix sync soon
* 🖱️ Several variants of Razer DeathAdder  
  (though I do miss my Intellimouse Pro from before its scroll wheel died)
* ⌨️ Too many mechanical keyboards, preferences lately settling towards linear switches in 68% or TKL layouts
* 📱 a Nothing Phone (2)
* 🎧 KOSS headphones KSC75, KSC35 Wireless, KPH40i, Porta Pro \[Wireless\] (their wires don't last but they are cheap and sound excellent)
* 🔦 Zebralight SC64c LE with a sliced LH351D emitter for rosy, high CRI light out of a tiny, efficiently driven light
* 🟢 Two small virtual private servers from RackNerd via [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com) deals
