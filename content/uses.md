This is a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page

## Hardware

* 💻 ThinkPad Z13 (AMD 6850U, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 x [Fedora 41 KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/))  
  *Note: I've been unable to get the soldered-in Qualcomm wireless chip to maintain a consistent connection in Linux. Buyer beware.*
* 💽 A [51nb X210](https://blog.mattgauger.com/2022/08/01/the-51nb-x210/) running [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) as a small homelab server with a built-in UPS :^)
* ⌨️ WOBKEY Rainy75 (Kailh Cocoa linears), Feker Galaxy80 (Keygeek X Neo Oat linears)
* 📱 a Nothing Phone (2)
* 🎧 SIVGA SV007 headphones at my desk, Jabra Elite 4 Active on the go
* 🔦 Zebralight SC64c LE with a sliced LH351D emitter for rosy, high CRI light out of a tiny, efficiently driven light
* 🖱️ Pulsar Xlite V2, Razer Deathadder V2 Pro

## Software

* 🧭 [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) to Win+Drag move, resize windows
* 🗒️ [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) depending on my mood.  
  * I haven't quite decided if [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is worth learning the muscle memory for, but I like it as well.
* 📺 [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) interfaces: [YTDLnis for Android](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis) and [stacher](https://stacher.io/)
* 🌍 [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) with [floccus](https://floccus.org/) bookmark sync, [ScrollAnywhere](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scrollanywhere/jehmdpemhgfgjblpkilmeoafmkhbckhi?hl=en-US) for rapid `MOUSE3` click-and-drag scrolling
* 🦈 [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) remains the most valuable tool for network and application troubleshooting I have
* ✉️ Gmail, because I haven't yet been convinced of the benefits of [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) or sprung for a subscription to [hey](https://www.hey.com)

## Services

* 🟢 Two small virtual private servers from RackNerd via [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com) deals
* 🐿️ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because if my code is going to be on their servers anyway, and I want my site on a CDN, I may as well do it all in one place for free. Hopefully nobody will embrace-extend-extinguish it :^)

## Vehicles
* 🚗 My trusty 2007 Lexus GS450h is old enough to vote, yet has 340HP and gets 25mpg thanks to its forward-thinking [hybrid synergy drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive)
* 🏍️ 2010 Kawasaki KLX250S
