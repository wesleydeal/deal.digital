This is a [/uses](https://uses.tech/) page

## Hardware

* 💻 ThinkPad Z13 (AMD 6850U, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 x [Fedora 40 KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/))
* ⌨️ Too many mechanical keyboards, preferences lately settling towards linear switches in 68% or TKL layouts
* 📱 a Nothing Phone (2)
* 🎧 KOSS headphones KSC75, KSC35 Wireless, KPH40i, Porta Pro \[Wireless\] (their wires don't last but they are cheap and sound excellent)
* 🔦 Zebralight SC64c LE with a sliced LH351D emitter for rosy, high CRI light out of a tiny, efficiently driven light
* 🖱️ Several variants of Razer DeathAdder  
  (though I do miss my Intellimouse Pro from before its scroll wheel died)


## Software

* 🧭 [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) to Win+Drag move, resize windows
* 🗒️ [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or [neovim](https://neovim.io/) depending on my mood.  
  * Yes, these all run on Windows as well.
  * I haven't quite decided if [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) is worth learning the muscle memory for, but I like it as well.
* 📺 [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) interfaces: [YTDLnis for Android](https://github.com/deniscerri/ytdlnis) and [stacher](https://stacher.io/)
* 🌍 Brave Browser, although I'm considering a move to Firefox if the devs don't fix sync soon

## Services

* 🟢 Two small virtual private servers from RackNerd via [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com) deals
* 🐿️ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because if my code is going to be on their servers anyway, and I want my site on a CDN, I may as well do it all in one place for free. Hopefully nobody will embrace-extend-extinguish it :^)

## Vehicles
* 🚗 My trusty 2007 Lexus GS450h
  * uses its awesome [hybrid synergy system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Synergy_Drive) to get me a whopping... 25mpg
  * but it's practically old enough to vote and it has 340 horsepower that I use most of
* 🏍️ 2010 Kawasaki KLX250S
