* 💻 ThinkPad Z13 (AMD 6850U, 16GB RAM, Windows 11 x Fedora 40 KDE)
* 🧭 [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap) to Win+Drag move, resize windows
* 🗒️ Kate, Notepad++, or neovim depending on my mood. Yes, Kate and neovim run on Windows.
* 🌍 Brave Browser, although I'm considering a move to Firefox if the devs don't fix sync soon
* 🖱️ Several variants of Razer DeathAdder  
  (though I do miss my Intellimouse Pro from before its scroll wheel died)
* ⌨️ Too many mechanical keyboards, preferences lately settling towards linear switches in 68% or TKL layouts
* 📱 a Nothing Phone (2)
* 🎧 KOSS headphones of various types (their wires don't last but they are cheap and sound excellent)
* 🔦 Zebralight SC64c LE with a sliced LH351D emitter for rosy, high CRI light out of a tiny, efficiently driven light
* 🟢 Two small virtual private servers from RackNerd via [LowEndBox](https://lowendbox.com) deals
