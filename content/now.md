{% blockquote(author="Derek Silvers",url="https://nownownow.com/about") %}
a website with a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a "now page".

## Building out this website

After finishing a series of additions to my [resume](/resume) and the embedded article explaining my process, I set to work on improving the content and design of the rest of the site once again. Perhaps I've already had a few too many late evenings tweaking CSS, but it's been fun. I think I'm approaching the end of my runway on visual tweaks though; soon I'll need to start writing some real content. I might enjoy writing about:
* cool user interface designs from the past and present
* the remaining blockers before the fabled *Year of the Linux Desktop* (although [Mike may have this covered](https://yearofthelinuxdesktop.net) in a more comprehensive way than I could hope to)
* Android apps that don't suck
* How I lost 100lb (a question I need to explore a little myself)

One other idea I've had with this site is that I'd like to set it up to house my personal homepage with frequently used links and a meta-search/command engine. `dealnav` ðŸ§­ would in theory offer:

* instant(ish) results from the contents of this site
* instant calculator results
* shortcuts to query
	* Google
	* Google Images
	* Brave Search
	* ChatGPT (search)
	* DuckDuckGo
	* YouTube
	* YouTube Music
	* Genius
	* Twitter
	* Instagram
	* Wikipedia
	* GitHub

The idea being that I could have a browser-agnostic setup of bookmarks and search providers that I could easily share with others or use on an unfamiliar computer.

A lot of the ideas here probably belong on a future /ideas page. 

## Fitness

At the moment, I'm around 170lb at a bit over 17% body fat. I'd like to be around 155lb, or 12% (smart scale reported) body fat, whichever I reach last.
I lift weights 4-7 days a week and target â‰¥10,000 steps per day. I run regularly, typically 5k in distance once or twice a week (but have lately been
out of commission due to heel blisters from new shoes).

## Working on my mindset

It's become clear that a significant proportion of the problems in my life exist in my head as stress or lack of self confidence. So I've set myself a
fairly general goal for the time being: become the best, most confident possible version of myself, and stop piling on new musts, what-ifs, and should-haves.
I can only make decisions at the margin, and what I decide will maximize my livelihood going forward. I will be decided and imperturbable.
