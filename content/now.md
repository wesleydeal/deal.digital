{% blockquote(author="Derek Silvers",url="https://nownownow.com/about") %}
a website with a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a "now page".
{% end %}

It's a bit meta to say so here, but I'm in the process of rewriting this page.

## Tweaking this website

After finishing a series of additions to my [resume](/resume) and the embedded article explaining my process, I set to work on improving the content and design of the rest of the site once again. Perhaps I've already had a few too many late evenings tweaking CSS, but it's been fun. I think I'm approaching the end of my runway on visual tweaks though; soon I'll need to start writing some real content.

## Fitness

At the moment, I'm around 170lb at a bit over 17% body fat. I'd like to be around 155lb, or 12% (smart scale reported) body fat, whichever I reach last.
I lift weights 4-7 days a week and target ≥10,000 steps per day. I run regularly, typically 5k in distance once or twice a week (but have lately been
out of commission due to heel blisters from new shoes).

## Working on confidence

It's become clear that a significant proportion of the problems in my life exist in my head as stress or lack of self confidence. So I've set myself a
fairly general goal for the time being: become the best, most confident possible version of myself, and stop piling on new musts, what-ifs, and should-haves.
I can only make decisions at the margin, and what I decide will maximize my livelihood going forward. I will be decided and imperturbable.
