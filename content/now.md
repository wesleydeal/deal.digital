a website with a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a "now page".

**Fitness** is a major focus of mine for a few years now. My goal at this point is to reach 15% bodyfat and build a noticeable amount of muscle. In addition to running and lifting weights, I have recently gotten into hiking and I'm trying out 100 push-ups per day.

**Hiking** has really grown on me in the last 6 months. I frequent [Pine Mountain](https://www.cityofcartersville.org/pinemountain/page/pine-mountain-trail-map) in Cartersville, GA because it's a decent length, steep trail with beautiful views and a scenic summit. There are connecting trails going to and beyond Cooper's Furnace, prefect on days that I have time and energy to spare.

**Building this website** is aimed at holding me accountable to define and follow through on my goals. In addition to developing new technical skills, I'd like to get better at expressing myself and hone my writing.

## Improving my skillset
I recently got a CompTIA Security+ certification. I found the material easy to grasp, and have been
evaluating my next step. Here's what I'm thinking:

I have never been a big proponent or user of "the cloud" as a whole and its spawned concepts:
Infrastructure as Code, microservice architecture, DevOps. I've operated under the assumption that
old fashioned on-premises monolithic infrastructure is usually cheaper and comes with less
surprises, and so far the conservative approach has worked out well. But time and tide wait for no
man, and it is clear that most IT administration roles require expertise in cloud architecture.

I'm exploring my options in terms of relevant projects and certifications
but here's what the shortlist looks like now:

 * The [Cloud Resume Challenge (Azure)](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/)
 * Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate ([AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification))
 * The [contoso-real-estate](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate) Enterprise-grade Reference Architecture for JavaScript
 * [An over-engineered Home Lab with Docker and Kubernetes](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/engineering/2023-01-06-over-engineered-home-lab-docker-kubernetes/) by Fernando Cejas

## Motorcycling

Early this year, I purchased a Kawasaki KLX250S. It's a small dual-sport (dirt & street riding) bike. The
idea was to recapture what I enjoyed about riding dirt bikes with my dad years ago, and to have
something that could get me to trails without needing a truck. I've yet to really take it offroad,
but I have thoroughly enjoyed riding the thing on the street even though it vibrates like crazy---a
single cylinder flying up and down at 8000rpm just to reach ~60mph.

At the moment, I'm waiting for my rear tire to be replaced by a local shop. I'm going with
something more road-oriented: a Shinko 244 to replace the old Kendra K760 that perished due to an
unfortunate encounter with a screw and a couple of miles of riding flat.
