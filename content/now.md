How did you get here? I don't even link to this page yet.

{% blockquote(author="Derek Silvers",url="https://nownownow.com/about") %}
a website with a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a "now page".

## Improving my skillset
It's come to my attention that the majority of organizations do not now operate off of mostly
Windows servers, managed as pets, hosted on the premises. The IT industry at large has adopted
concepts such as 'Infrastructure as Code' and 'cloud-first architecture' under the view that this
makes things cheaper, easier, and safer to manage. I have yet to see clear evidence that this
holds true for anyone but the largest organizations.

But time and tide wait for no man, and it is clear that most higher-level IT administration roles
will involve expertise in cloud architecture. I recently got a CompTIA Security+ certification and
I'm exploring my options in terms of projects and certifications relating to "cloud" and "DevOps"
but here's what the shortlist looks like now:

 * The [Cloud Resume Challenge (Azure)](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/)
 * Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate ([AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification))
 * The [contoso-real-estate](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate) Enterprise-grade Reference Architecture for JavaScript
 * [An over-engineered Home Lab with Docker and Kubernetes](https://fernandocejas.com/blog/engineering/2023-01-06-over-engineered-home-lab-docker-kubernetes/) by Fernando Cejas

## Motorcycling

Early this year, I purchased a Kawasaki KLX250S. It's a small dual-sport (dirt & street riding) bike. The
idea was to recapture what I enjoyed about riding dirt bikes with my dad years ago, and to have
something that could get me to trails without needing a truck. I've yet to really take it offroad,
but I have thoroughly enjoyed riding the thing on the street even though it vibrates like crazy---a
single cylinder flying up and down at 8000rpm just to reach ~60mph.

At the moment, I'm waiting for my rear tire to be replaced by a local shop. I'm going with
something more road-oriented: a Shinko 244 to replace the old Kendra K760 that perished due to an
unfortunate encounter with a screw and a couple of miles of riding flat.
