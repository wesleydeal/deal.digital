{% blockquote(author="Derek Silvers",url="https://nownownow.com/about") %}
a website with a link that says "now" goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a "now page".
{% end %}

It's a bit meta to say so here, but I'm in the process of rewriting this page.

## Tweaking this website

After finishing a series of additions to my [resume](/resume) and the embedded article explaining my process, I set to work on improving the content and design of the rest of the site once again. Perhaps I've already had a few too many late evenings tweaking CSS, but it's been fun. I think I'm approaching the end of my runway on visual tweaks though; soon I'll need to start writing some real content.

## Fitness

Still trying to build a bit more muscle and drop a few pounds. Well, ideally I'd focus on the latter first followed by the former, but I keep getting distracted by my own gluttony. From my peak of 280 I'm now hovering in the low 170s, but I believe 155lb is a good target to reach before I start a slow bulk.

# Then
