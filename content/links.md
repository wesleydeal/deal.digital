Because Brave [doesn't reliably sync my bookmarks](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/35042) any more and search engines are less useful by the day, here's a bunch of links I find useful or interesting.

## Typography

### Sans-serif Typefaces

* [Alegraya Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans) feels a bit older and more hand-etched than most sans-serifs
* [Marcellus](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus), a Trajan-esque title font with lowercase that feels a bit like Optima
* [Averia Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Sans+Libre), the averages of every sans-serif on Dan Sayer's computer
* [National Park](https://nationalparktypeface.com/) looks like router-cut signs with perfectly rounded ends
* [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) has rounded ends that feel more squircle than circle
* [Wolf Sans](https://fonts2u.com/wolf-sans-regular.font) bears a striking resemblance to the legends on the IBM Model M keyboard
* [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) is a nicely balanced rounded sans-serif as is its derivative [SN Pro](https://supernotes.app/open-source/sn-pro/)
* [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) lacks the aforementioned rounding
* [Red Hat Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display) and [Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Text) are lovely readable sans-serifs used on this very site
* [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) is variable and pleasant, if a bit vanilla. Helvetica-esque
* [Open Sauce](https://github.com/marcologous/Open-Sauce-Fonts) ([demo](https://www.behance.net/gallery/94876543/Open-Sauce-Sans-Typeface)) is another Helvetica-esque with distinctive inktraps
* [Metropolis](https://fontesk.com/metropolis-typeface/) (used for Mozilla Firefox titling) and VMware's version [Clarity City](https://fontesk.com/clarity-city-typeface/) are nice. The author seems to have gotten in some sort of spat with Jonathan Hoefler about its resemblance to Gotham
* [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) has a bit of personality. Corporate, computery, and very safely playful. On-brand.

### Serif Typefaces
* [STIX Two Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text) is a true rarity: a Times-based font that I don't find ugly. Designed for scientific journals, but looks nice most anywhere.
* [Averia](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Libre) & [Averia Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Serif+Libre) are the averages of every font on Dan Sayers' computer
* [Vollkorn](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Vollkorn) is beefy & homegrown, like a stew
* [XCharter](https://fontesk.com/xcharter-typeface/) nicely extend's Matthew Carter's simple screen font, [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html)
* [Source Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4) is in a very similar vein to Charter, but with more characters and weights. I love its distinctive '?' glyph

### Monospace Typefaces
* [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code). Yeah, I know it's M$ and it's now a default font, but it's pretty and readable.

### Tools
* [Variable font helper](https://variable-font-helper.web.app/) to select, compress, and host variable fonts from Google fonts
