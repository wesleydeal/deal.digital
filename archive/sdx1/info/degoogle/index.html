	<h1>DeGoogle Yourself: An Incomplete Guide to Rid Yourself of Abusive Software</h1>
	<p class="meta">Updated 2018-10-29. Written by sdx1, originally published 2018-10-30.</p>
	<h2>Why DeGoogle Yourself?</h2>
	<p>Google, a company that once used the motto "don't be evil" now owns a concerning amount of the world's technological infrastructure and has <a href="invidio.us/watch?v=-he5S1UFeC8">clear political motives</a>. Lately there has been <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/390521673/The-Good-Censor-GOOGLE-LEAK#from_embed">evidence</a> that their intentions are turning towards <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/youtube-bans-firearm-sales-and-how-to-videos-prompting-backlash">censorship</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/401514-report-google-stores-users-location-data-despite-privacy-settings">spying</a>. Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon are also guilty of similar behavior to some extent. And Microsoft and Apple have long been fans of anticompetitive and anti-consumer practices (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace%2C_extend%2C_and_extinguish">EEE</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/apple-responds-over-iphone-4-reception-issues-youre-holding-th/">you're holding it wrong</a>). In short, this page is essentially a guide on how to get rid of corporate influence from your computing experience. You may find that many options on this page are too restrictive for you, so just keep in mind that any detachment you can get from abusive companies like Google is an improvement.</p>
	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<p>First thing to know: modern <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-the-intel-management-engine-a-backdoor/">Intel</a> and <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kzpm5x/amd-secure-processor-ryzen-epyc-vulnerabilities-and-backdoors">AMD</a> hardware likely both have backdoors. Your best bet for privacy is something from <a href="https://libreboot.org/suppliers.html">this list</a> running open-source firmware. Otherwise, just keep in mind that your computer is potentially insecure.</p>
	<p>Cell phones are inherently insecure and give away your location to the phone company at all times just based on their nature. Privacy with cell phones is a losing battle, so all you can do is try and limit the number of companies with access to this data to only your carrier. I'm not aware of any hardware backdoors for phones, but it's quite likely that they do exist for most of them.</p>
	<h2>Operating System</h2>
	<p>I don't advise using Windows or Mac, but for many people this is a must. If you're not willing to go with a Linux distribution, at least use something like <a href="https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10">O&O ShutUp10</a> to disable some of Windows 10's more egregious anti-features.</p>
	<p>With regards to Linux, my suggestions tend towards KDE Neon or Xubuntu for inexperienced users, and towards Arch, Debian, Devuan, and Slackware for those more willing to poke around</p>
	<p>Those willing to go the extra mile for security and privacy with their computers may find <a href="https://www.whonix.org/">Whonix</a> and <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">TAILS</a> useful for their purposes. But working with these systems will considerably complicate your computing experience.</p>
	<p>For phones, your only non-abusive option these days is pretty much Android without Google Apps installed. This means getting a phone with flashable firmware and then installing a non-Google firmware, microG, and F-Droid for an app store. <a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for MicroG</a> already has all of these features included. Regardless, your phone is still a spying device for at least the government and your phone carrier, so if it's possible for you to live without one or keep it turned off most of the time, maybe you should.</p>

	<h2>Browser</h2>
	<p>My primary recommendation is the Chromium-based <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>, which includes ad blocking and enables many privacy features by default, as well as allowing you to automatically pay creators of content you view if you desire. It runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android, and it can do pretty much anything Chrome does (except currently user profile sync). But here's some other options you may want to consider:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/">UnGoogled Chromium</a> - if you love Google Chrome but don't want to bother with Brave</li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon</a> - if you happened to like older versions of Firefox</li>
	    <li><a href="https://firefox.com">Mozilla Firefox</a> - still reasonably freedom- and privacy-focused these days</li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.falkon.org/">Falkon</a> - a little browser with ad blocking but no extensions or hardware acceleration</li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser</a> - anonymous but slow</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Search Engines</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> - good (mostly Bing-sourced) results, useful !-prefixed shortcuts, doesn't track you</li>
	    <li><a href="https://new.startpage.com">Startpage</a> - good (mostly Google-sourced) results without the tracking; sometimes slow</li>
	    <li><a href="https://searx.me">Searx.me</a> - open source search engine</li>
	    <li><a href="https://lite.qwant.com">Qwant</a> - a French search engine without bias or tracking</li>
	</ul>
