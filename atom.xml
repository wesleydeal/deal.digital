upgrade. I wanted to create a modern-looking notification popup, and I want to make sure that it wouldn’t
display if we accidentally applied it to a Windows 11 user. I don’t have a dark mode implemented or anything of the sort,
but I got as close as I could with the fonts, button, and button pane. Here’s what I came up with:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the icon to display, you’ll need to switch the meta tag to IE=9, but this causes the
dialog to briefly flicker at a larger window size on load which I found not to be worth the trade-off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course you can remove the first script block if you want a notice that displays on any
Windows version.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://deal.digital/blog/design-principles/"/>
        <id>https://deal.digital/blog/design-principles/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://deal.digital/blog/design-principles/">&lt;p&gt;I’m a tech guy, and as a general rule, tech guys don’t make great UIs. Nonetheless,
I enjoy tinkering with websites and graphic design as a bit of a hobby. This site
has become something of a playground for me to exercise my CSS skills, and I’ve
decided it’s time to put in writing some of the ideas that have been in my head
while I mess with it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-technical&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-technical&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-technical&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A. Technical&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do much with little: a standard text-only blog page should require &amp;lt;512KB of resources on first load.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s needed to render the page, load it all at once, as quickly as possible. No import chains.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But if it’s not, load it later. Prefer hiding the asynchronous nature, silently degrading until the resource is loaded.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The page should gracefully degrade for older&#x2F;simpler browsers. Specifically, the inline stylesheet should allow for
a pleasant reading experience in even Firefox 3 and the structure should do the same for lynx.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid loading images where possible.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;b-aesthetic&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#b-aesthetic&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: b-aesthetic&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;B. Aesthetic&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eschew corporate “flat design” and reflexive minimalism.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borrow elements from different eras of computing history, including 1980s terminals and graphical desktop environments from 1993-2009.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBM AS&#x2F;400&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*nixen&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MS-DOS and compatibles&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 3, 95, 98, 2000, XP MCE, Longhorn, Vista&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS&#x2F;2 Warp&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple II series&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac OS System 7, 8, 9, Rhapsody, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple print advertisements&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KDE 3.5&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNOME 2 from Ubuntu 8.04–10.10&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winamp &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skins.webamp.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Skins 🦙&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac OS &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;macthemes.garden&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XP &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviantart.com&#x2F;jamush&#x2F;art&#x2F;Watercolor-Emico-Black-89206761&quot;&gt;Themes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradients are underrated.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everything needs rounded corners.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depth adds interest and helps the user feel grounded, if it is coherent.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use relative colors, such that the page looks good with ANY selected primary color.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn’t Neocities: keep styles coherent such that most of the site is obviously in the same design language.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This isn’t Serious Business: a little bit of whimsy doesn’t hurt&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;c-usability-accessibility&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#c-usability-accessibility&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: c-usability-accessibility&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;C. Usability &amp;amp; Accessibility&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactable elements should be obvious, and their function telegraphed by their appearance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headings and body text should be readable with a sane size and line width. The font size should follow the user’s browser defaults.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images need alt tags.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semantic HTML elements are preferred to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider screen sizes from 350x350 to 4K at standard DPI.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrast matters.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither light mode nor dark mode receives preferential treatment.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;

Copy your Windows ISO to it. &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schneegans.de&#x2F;windows&#x2F;unattend-generator&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Build an autounattend.xml with this tool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; then use &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ventoy.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;plugin_plugson.html&quot;&gt;VentoyPlugson&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to point at the XML file on the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ventoy.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;plugin_autoinstall.html&quot;&gt;Autoinstall&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boot your flash drive and install to the preferred disk. Activate using your legitimate product key and not, for example, some kind of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Activation Script&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; you pulled from GitHub :^)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll need is a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oo-software.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;shutup10&quot;&gt;O&amp;amp;O ShutUp10&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisTitusTech&#x2F;winutil&quot;&gt;Chris Titus’s Windows Utility&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Go through and disable all telemetry and ads (though you may want to leave some, like location services).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows includes lots of animations that slow you down (start menu, smoother cursor in office applications, smooth Page Up&#x2F;Down), and they can all be turned off in Settings &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Visual effects &amp;gt; Animation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a browser that isn’t the ad-ridden spyware that is Edge–try &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;librewolf.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;LibreWolf&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brave.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Brave&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with crypto wallet disabled.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quickest way I’ve found to get most software for Windows these days is using WinGet. I can’t make promises as to exactly how well-moderated the package sources are, but I’ve yet to encounter

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windhawk.net&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Windhawk&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will help you reclaim screen real estate by setting taskbar height and icon size to 36 and 20 respectively (pair with button width 32 for best results).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RamonUnch&#x2F;AltSnap&quot;&gt;AltSnap&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will allow you to drag and snap windows around using the Alt (or if configured, Super) key so that you don’t have to target the edge of the window just to resize or find the titlebar to move it. If you’re used to Linux desktop environments, it’s a little itchy to live without this feature.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;information&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;About this tool&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I use the JavaScript function &lt;i&gt;&lt;code&gt;crypto.getRandomValues&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; to generate secure pseudorandom unsigned 32-bit integers in the range of [0, 4294967295].
		One Uint32 is used to pick each character of each password. On modern hardware, this is so blazingly fast that when you hold the button, the passwords update
		at the refresh rate of your display.
	&lt;p&gt;These passwords are generated entirely in your browser. You will note that this page contains no mechanism to send these passwords to any server.
		Generating 50 at once should act as a weak hedge against the possibility that the pseudorandom function on your system is compromised, because
		you can select both the time to generate passwords and the specific one you use at random. You can also opt to scramble the ordering of the alphabet used
		based on an array of numbers derived from the timestamps and values of your mouse and keyboard input.
		The main security advantage of this site for you is that if you view the page source, it should be short enough to parse and verify it does what it claims.
	&lt;p&gt;Password entropy is determined with the formula log₂(A&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;) where A is the alphabet and L is the length.
	&lt;p&gt;The time to crack is estimated by 2&lt;sup&gt;entropy&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; ÷ hashRate ÷ 2. (We divide by 2 because, on average, the password will be found halfway through the search.)
	&lt;p&gt;For the hash rate, I&#x27;ve selected a ~$2000 GPU (RTX 5090) and a weak but common hash (NTLM) which is used by Windows to store local and network passwords.
		Ideally, your application should use a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; better hash function which will take orders of magnitude longer to brute force.

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to keep a backup from every day of the last week, as well as copies from 2, 3, and 4 weeks ago, 1, 2, and 3 months ago, 1 and 2 years ago. You can try it from the folder in question with the &lt;code&gt;-WhatIf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;ps1&quot; class=&quot;language-ps1 z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ps1&quot; data-lang=&quot;ps1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-powershell&quot;&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Prune&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Backups.ps1 &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Days &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-powershell&quot;&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Weeks &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-powershell&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Months &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-powershell&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Years &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-powershell&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-powershell&quot;&gt;-&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;WhatIf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will report back which files would be deleted, which would be kept, and how much space you’ll save.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can create a scheduled daily task, pointing to a specific path and removing the &lt;code&gt;-WhatIf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program&#x2F;script&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Add arguments (optional)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;-NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Scripts\Prune-Backups.ps1 -Path &quot;C:\ProgramData\Vendor\Backups\&quot; -Days 7 -Weeks 4 -Months 3 -Years 2&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; No matter what, the most recent item in the folder will be kept. The default behavior of the script, if called with no parameters, is to keep only the most recent file.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

	&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-out-this-website&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#building-out-this-website&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: building-out-this-website&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Building out this website&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing a series of additions to my &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;resume&quot;&gt;resume&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and the embedded article explaining my process, I set to work on improving the content and design of the rest of the site once again. Perhaps I’ve already had a few too many late evenings tweaking CSS, but it’s been fun. I think I’m approaching the end of my runway on visual tweaks though; soon I’ll need to start writing some real content. I might enjoy writing about:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cool user interface designs from the past and present&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the remaining blockers before the fabled &lt;em&gt;Year of the Linux Desktop&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (although &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yearofthelinuxdesktop.net&quot;&gt;Mike may have this covered&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a more comprehensive way than I could hope to)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android apps that don’t suck&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I lost 100lb (a question I need to explore a little myself)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other idea I’ve had with this site is that I’d like to set it up to house my personal homepage with frequently used links and a meta-search&#x2F;command engine. &lt;code&gt;dealnav&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; 🧭 would in theory offer:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instant(ish) results from the contents of this site&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;instant calculator results&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortcuts to query
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Images&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brave Search&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT (search)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube Music&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genius&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea being that I could have a browser-agnostic setup of bookmarks and search providers that I could easily share with others or use on an unfamiliar computer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the ideas here probably belong on a future &#x2F;ideas page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m around 170lb at a bit over 17% body fat. I’d like to be around 155lb, or 12% (smart scale reported) body fat, whichever I reach last.
I lift weights 4-7 days a week and target ≥10,000 steps per day. I run regularly, typically 5k in distance once or twice a week (but have lately been
out of commission due to heel blisters from new shoes).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s become clear that a significant proportion of the problems in my life exist in my head as stress or lack of self confidence. So I’ve set myself a
fairly general goal for the time being: become the best, most confident possible version of myself, and stop piling on new musts, what-ifs, and should-haves.
I can only make decisions at the margin, and what I decide will maximize my livelihood going forward. I will be decided and imperturbable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://deal.digital/blog/librechat/">&lt;p&gt;Do you want to deploy an inexpensive ChatGPT-like web app for your school, business, or friends?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deal.digital&#x2F;blog&#x2F;librechat&#x2F;librechat-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;LibreChat screenshot&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreChat has a vast array of features and can utilize multiple LLM backends, but today we’ll cover setting it up as a way to pay for OpenAI tokens rather than ChatGPT’s flat fee. The official docs are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.librechat.ai&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.librechat.ai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one API key from a supported service such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this document assumes you have an OpenAI key with at least a couple bucks worth of credit&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alternatively, consider a custom endpoint using OpenRouter and one of their free models&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A spare, preferably unused server with Linux, open to inbound internet traffic on ports 80 and 443
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a virtual machine or Raspberry Pi with Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Oracle, or Rocky Linux&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t care for on-prem? Inexpensive Virtual Private Servers can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lowendbox.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;lowendbox.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or on Oracle Cloud’s &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oracle.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;free&#x2F;&quot;&gt;free tier&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or use your cloud compute flavor of choice.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A subdomain with an A record pointed at your server
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subdomain makes it easy for us to set up secure access and single sign-on.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Google Workspace domain to use for single sign-on&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The last three are optional; if you are so inclined, LibreChat can run locally on your Windows computer for testing.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to first install the latest official versions of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;engine&#x2F;install&#x2F;#supported-platforms&quot;&gt;Docker Engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (for managing the LibreChat container) and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caddyserver.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;install&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (to provide a reverse web proxy for security and performance, and enable automatic TLS certificate setup).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a service account and directory for LibreChat:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configure Caddy to serve LibreChat. Open &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;etc&#x2F;caddy&#x2F;Caddyfile&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with an editor&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should automatically retrieve a certificate and start serving as a reverse proxy for LibreChat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now visit your subdomain, create an account with your email address and a new password, and test out the service. (The developers of the platform state that the first account created is automatically registered as an administrator, though there is not yet an administrative web interface.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues? You may need to check your port forwarding, firewall settings, DNS on the client, server, and your nameservers, the caddy logs (&lt;code&gt;journalctl -u caddy --since today&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;), the LibreChat console output (&lt;code&gt;docker attach&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App information&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to select Internal to only allow accounts in your Google Cloud domain to authenticate.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;App domain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure the &lt;strong&gt;application home page&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Authorized domains&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are set to the subdomain you have pointed at LibreChat. Add your administrative email address as the &lt;strong&gt;Developer contact information&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scopes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&#x2F;auth&#x2F;userinfo.email&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After saving and completing the consent screen setup, return to the &lt;strong&gt;Credentials&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; page, click &lt;strong&gt;CREATE CREDENTIALS&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and create an Oauth client ID. You’ll want to set it as a Web application named LibreChat with authorized origin &lt;code&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subdomain.yourdomain.com&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and authorized redirect URI &lt;code&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subdomain.yourdomain.com&#x2F;oauth&#x2F;google&#x2F;callback&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Once you click CREATE, you will receive a client ID and client secret. You’ll then add them to your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instructions above will get you up and running, but if you want a stable, secure, and correctly configured system, you’ll at least want to consider some of the following:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the full documentation for LibreChat and configured desired options&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;askubuntu.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1459175&#x2F;how-to-run-a-docker-compose-as-a-systemd-service&quot;&gt;systemd unit file&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automatically start LibreChat’s docker containers as the librechat user&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up your distribution’s preferred firewall to disallow inbound connections to ports other than 80 and 443 (and SSH 22 from trusted addresses)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and configure fail2ban to protect your SSH logins if you publicly expose port 22&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure some form of backups&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://deal.digital/blog/shorelock/">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that you’re a very busy systems administrator. A while ago, something popped up on the top of your Shoretel management page. You noticed it when you were hastily onboarding a new employee:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to license violation, access to Director will be locked in 38 days. Take proper action before the grace period has expired. Note that there are additional charges if you need to recover from a locked Director.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made a mental note and moved onto the next task.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 weeks later, a ticket arrives requesting a voicemail PIN reset. You go into the director but find that you’re now locked out entirely. How can you fix it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-process&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-process&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Process&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: I cannot comment on the legal or technical ramifications of poking around in the running production database of your vendor software to bypass a license restriction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote in to your Shoretel server. If Shoretel is holding your server hostage on a very old version of Windows, you might need to disable CredSSP remediation on your box with&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;cmd&quot; class=&quot;language-cmd z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-cmd&quot; data-lang=&quot;cmd&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-dosbatch&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-command z-dosbatch&quot;&gt;reg&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters &#x2F;v AllowEncryptionOracle &#x2F;t REG_DWORD &#x2F;d &lt;span class=&quot;z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-decimal z-dosbatch&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.mysql.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;workbench&#x2F;&quot;&gt;MySQL Workbench&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the server.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a connection with these details:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostname: &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port: &lt;code&gt;4308&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;code&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect with the password &lt;code&gt;shorewaredba&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this query:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sql&quot; class=&quot;language-sql z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-DML z-sql&quot;&gt;select&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; UserDNID,UserDN,GuiLoginName,LicenseTypeID,ClientType &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-DML z-sql&quot;&gt;from&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; users &lt;span class=&quot;z-keyword z-other z-DML z-sql&quot;&gt;order by&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; licensetypeID
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the table that appears, edit the license type  numbers for LicenseTypeID and ClientType to reduce your license count. Refer to the locked director for which license you’re over on. Refer to this table for the meaning of license type numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bottom right corner, click &lt;strong&gt;Apply&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, review the changes, and &lt;strong&gt;Apply&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; again. Exit MySQL Workbench.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the Shoretel-Director service (or, if preferred, the entire server).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still operating under the advice that you have to avoid Windows updates for Mitel Connect, you should consider &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shoretelforums.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;shoretel-tech&#x2F;installers&#x2F;80664-windows-updates&quot;&gt;changing your approach&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;About the Libram&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All content on this page, including the spells and the following paragraphs, are adapted from &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;centralia.aquest.com&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;NLRMEv2.pdf&quot;&gt;Orrex&#x27;s original document&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Ideally, the DM is supposed to look up the effect based on the player&#x27;s roll, but I recommend that the DM does the roll if this tool is used.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First things first!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;

The reader is encouraged to substitute more a mellifluous term in place of &quot;Chaos Burst&quot; if so inclined, but that ís what I&#x27;m calling them&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&#x27;s changed in this edition?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made an effort to omit references to copyrighted materials, including proprietary spell names. Generic effects such as “fireball” or “teleport” still pop up in the list, but these effects are so commonplace in fantasy that no single source can truly claim ownership of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time it occurred to me that version 1.20 includes hundreds of target-affecting Bursts very likely inappropriate and useless to gaming. Too many Bursts affect the target’s spellbook or his familiar, or they involve subtleties of the target’s perceptions; I concluded that most Bursts probably won’t be triggered against magic-using targets, so any Burst that plays upon such a target would miss the mark. Also, since PC’s don’t usually have access to an NPC’s thoughts, it would often be pointless to make the target think that he’s directly in line for the throne (especially if the target is an orc or troll soon to meet his demise). Better to make the target-affecting Bursts more immediate or visible for the greater enjoyment of the players.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing this edition, I deliberately included a handful of pop-culture references, in-jokes, and a few items of generic commentary. In the whole list there are probably fewer than a dozen, so they shouldn’t be a big deal during play. They’re all still playable despite their subject matter, but if they really derail your game, then roll that Burst again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What hasn&#x27;t changed?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wit remains just as dazzling, of course, and it shines from every single entry on the list. Beyond that, other features remain basically the same as in the original edition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I have used the pronouns &quot;he,&quot; &quot;him,&quot; and &quot;his&quot; throughout the list, but this is intended to save space rather than as a commentary on sex as it pertaisn to chaos bursts. As before, one shouldn&#x27;t infer a &quot;boys only&quot; attitude from this; female spellcasters can unleash chaos just as readily as their male counterparts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect that is largely the same is the description of area-affecting Bursts; the list still uses the terms &quot;nearby,&quot; &quot;here,&quot; &quot;in the area,&quot; and the like. If a range is not specified, the Gamemaster should assume an arbitrary distance large enough to be interesting but not so large as to be world-shattering. unless otherwise stated, all area-affecting Bursts should be assumed to originate from or center upon the intended spell&#x27;s intended target point. The terms &quot;target point&quot; and &quot;spell&#x27;s target point&quot; are used interchangeably.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why do Chaos Bursts happen?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some would suggest that casting a spell is analogous to going to a faucet for a drink of water. A conventional mage is like a normal person. He holds his glass beneath the spigot, turns on the tap, fills his glass to the desired level, and turns off the top. Simple, efficient, and orderly. However, the wild mage doesn&#x27;t work that way. Instead, he smashes the spigot with a hammer, tries to catch as much water as he wants in his glass, and then tries to reseal the ruptured faucet. Complicated, inefficient, and chaotic. And very likely to get the wild mage soaked in the process. So it is with magic. Instead of opening a precise channel for magical energy, the wild mage tears a gaping hole in reality and hopes to get a paritcular effect. If he can reseal the hole, great. If not, the result is a Chaos Burst.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What happened to the spell I tried to cast?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous edition I suggested that the intended spell be allowed to function unless directly contradicted by the Burst. I now feel this approach to be floawed and propsoe an alternative: the chance that a spell succeeds despite a Burst is equal to 10% per caster level minus 5% per level of the spell. Thus a 5th level mage who triggers a Burst when casting fireball has a 10% per caster level minus 5% per level of the spell. Thus a 5th level mage who triggers a Burst when casting fireball has a 35% (that is , (5 x 10) - (3 x 5)) chance to succeed. Otherwise, the spell fails and is lost from memory. Feel free to devise similar methods as you see fit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can conventional mages cause Chaos Bursts?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! In addition to Wild Magic regions, normal mages can cause Bursts if they are disrupted during the casting of a normal spell. Though unlikely at low levels, higher-power spells can wreak havoc if not properly cast. To represent this, consider that a miscast spell has a percent chance equal to the square of one plus its level to cause a Burst. That is, a 1st level spell has a 4% (1+1)2 chance, but a 9th level spell has a 100% (9+1)^2 chance. This can be modified by the mage’s level or some similar value, as determined by the GM.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do I get a Saving Throw?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is up to the GM, but I’d suggest against it for the most part. Unless the effect or the player’s resultant griping will fatally disrupt the campaign, let the chips fall where they may. Most Bursts are, after all, reversible, so even the most cantankerous player could be soothed by an interesting quest to remove the Burst’s effect. Comparatively few Bursts cause instant death, so there is little to fear except inconvenience. If someone is expressly protected against an effect, like bursting into flame, then the Burst can be considered negated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The description didn’t give a duration. How long does the effect last?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if no duration is specified, then a Burst should be considered permanent until dispelled. Alternatively, it may be appropriate for a Burst to persist for as long as the intended spell would have done, or one round per caster level—whichever is greater. A third possibility is to roll dice to determine the Burst’s duration in turns, hours, days, weeks, or whatever. Yet another option is to assume that the Burst will last until some apparently random condition is met, (a brief list of possible conditions is provided at the end of this document). However, if a Burst has an explicit duration, then it should be assumed that nothing short of divine intervention or a full Wish can cancel the effect before that time. Similarly, if a Burst has an instantaneous duration but a permanent effect, such as 1d10 of the target’s fingers vanishing, then the effect can’t be Dispelled per se; the target might be Healed, but there is no lingering magical effect to Dispel, so other remedies must be sought. As in the previous edition, any effort to dispel a Burst should be considered at least as difficult as an attempt to dispel magic cast by a mage twice the level of the caster who triggered the Burst.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it must be noted that many Bursts produce a beneficial effect in exchange for a heavy price; if the price is negated, then the benefit should also be negated. For example, fit he cater becomes immune to disease by cutting off his thumbs, then he should lose that immunity if his thumbs are restored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some of these are cool, but some are just downright silly. What gives?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how it goes. The list is designed to add interesting elements to role-playing, not simply to blow the caster out of his boots or to turn the target into a puddle of goo. Sure it&#x27;s nice that the target shrinks to 1&#x2F;12 his height, but isn&#x27;t it somehow more satisfying to have the caster think that all other magic users are out to get him? There are, to be sure, a bunch of powerful results, but these are ultimately less entertaining than the good role-playing required by some of the others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about Bursts that just don&#x27;t make sense?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effects with invisible or inappropriate results should be kept secret by the GM (at least from the characters) to preserve the mystery and danger of wild magic. If a fish has its feet enlarged or an aerial servant has half of its body turned invisible, the players should be told that nothing seems to happen. Such a statement could as easily mean a red dragon is now stalking the party but is not yet nearby. Likewise, a delayed effect should not be revealed until it occurs; if the caster is to turn into a duck under the next full moon, let him find out when the time comes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How&#x27;s it arranged?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s still broken into three main categories: those affecting the caster, his possessions, or his allies; those affecting the target, his possessions, or his allies; and those affecting objects or creatures in the surrounding area or the area itself. Also included in that last category are Bursts that implicitly affect neither the caster nor target but which lie in wait for some triggering effect to occur later. In addition, I&#x27;ve added a few really high powered results near the end of the list, and these are at least global in scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;There seems to be some duplication here!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reviewing version 1.20, I found that duplication was much more widespread than I’d originally realized, and I felt that this shortchanged the reader. Some will object that the current list still has a lot of thematic repetition; many Bursts involve the target disgorging some unlikely item or the caster befalling an awkward fate the next time he opens a door. Sure, these are broadly repetitive, but each result is sufficiently distinct, in my view, to count as a separate effect. In contrast, I know of at least one gaming system that touts its rulebook to contain over two thousand spells, but upon inspection one finds twenty variations of fireball, of lightning bolt, of polymorph, etc., until the list dwindles to around forty or fifty truly distinct spell effects. With this list, I think the variance is much greater.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What else is this list good for?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While intended for determining Choas Bursts, the table serves equally well in generating the effects of a Wand of Wonder or any similarly chaotic magical disaster. If the rolled BUrst refers to an &quot;intended spell effect,&quot; then the GM should determine how this applies, either choosing a spell at random from the character&#x27;s repertoire or simply rerolling the effect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about Gamemaster&#x27;s option other than that?&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM&#x27;s option should be exercised only if a Burst would so imbalance a campaign that it becomes unenjoyable. In an attempt to introduce a real quality of randomness to wild magic, this table presents a broad range of effects. In modifying a die roll in favor of one outcome or another, the Gm runs the risk of excluding randomness from the game. Therefore, I recommend that the resultant effect be used without modification whenver possible. I elaborate on this point a little later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Additional Notes on the Adjudication of Chaos Bursts&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is gained by excessive literalism in interpreting a Burst result; if a Burst calls for the caster’s waterskin to be filled with squid eggs, but the caster carries a canteen, then by all means make the Burst affect his canteen instead. This isn’t a blanket justification forarbitrarily zany interpretation of results, but it should make the Bursts more generally applicable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careful handling by the GM still makes all the difference. Many Bursts have no immediately discernible effect; it would be a great loss to the players to reveal the nature of the effect before it is actually manifest in the course of play. For this reason, spells whose primary purpose is to identify a Burst prematurely should be forbidden, or at least tightly constrained. Sure, a full Wish spell might work, but anything less than that should have at best a very low probability of success. The same goes for “Dispel Chaos Burst” or the like; if the whole point of wild magic is to embrace the dangers and benefits of chaos, then where’s the fun in establishing a bunch of safety nets and escape clauses? Such fail-safes should be avoided. Or let your players try to use them, each time triggering another Burst until they catch on and abandon the pursuit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re feeling particularly charitable, and if a Burst has an ongoing effect likely to result in a character’s speedy demise, you might allow the player to roll against the character’s intelligence to get a sense of what’s going on. For example, if the character is to lose one hit point per round until he says his name, a successful Intelligence check might inspire him to introduce himself to someone nearby, preferably just moments before it’s too late! Don’t apply this method if the Burst’s effect is simply delayed; it should only be used when a character’s death is imminent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along those same lines, if the victim’s perceptions, alignment, or beliefs are altered, then while they persist the player should proceed as if these alterations are complete and natural for the character. That is, if a Burst causes its victim to believe that his hands are made of candy, then he won’t want to be convinced otherwise. This is similar to magical alignment changes in the official game; the victim completely adopts the new alignment as if it’s his true inclination, and he won’t seek to alter or undo the change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This list sucks even worse than the last one! Who do I bitch to!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received quite a bit of email feedback about the list v1.20, and I’m grateful to everyone who took the time to contact me. One of the most common criticisms dealt with the inclusion of technologies that, to some people, simply seemed out of place. In this list, I’ve reduced the incidence of anachronistic objects and Bursts in the hope of diminishing that error.&lt;&#x2F;p.
&lt;p&gt;Comments and critiques are still welcome, of course. Send them to orrex@excite.com. I can’t guarantee that I’ll reply, but if there’s something you really need to get off your chest, feel free to drop me a line.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://deal.digital/blog/smart-seagate/">&lt;p&gt;Seagate hard drives often report extremely high read and seek error rates in SMART data. After pronouncing a string of drives defective based on these fields, I did some digging and found that Seagate drives use non-standard formatting for these values. Every piece of disk-monitoring software I had used reports these values incorrectly. Incidentally, this was good for our bottom line at the computer shop where we sold quite a few customers SSD upgrades partly on the basis of these mistaken readings. While the easiest advice on this subject is to ignore these values in the absence of other drive issues, there is a way to read them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated 2025: &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s.i.wtf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here’s a calculator&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; someone built to determine these values for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-process&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-process&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Process&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of programs that read SMART data rely on smartctl (&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sourceforge.net&#x2F;projects&#x2F;smartmontools&#x2F;files&#x2F;latest&#x2F;download?source=files&quot;&gt;Windows download&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), which we’ll use to read these values.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that our disk is located at &#x2F;dev&#x2F;hda (which is typical for smartctl on Windows and older Linuxes), we can get the disk status using &lt;code&gt;smartctl -A &#x2F;dev&#x2F;hda&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. The raw read error rate will be reported as something like &lt;strong&gt;130917967&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and the seek something like &lt;strong&gt;13219996990&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is clearly wrong, because the drive hasn’t failed or reported any SMART errors, and the normalized value still shows this attribute to be within acceptable margins.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the read and seek error rates are actually recorded as 48-bit hexadecimal values, where the first 16 bits (4 hex digits) represent the total number of read or seek errors and the last 32 bits (8 hex digits) represent the total number of reads or seeks attempted. We can get these values with the command &lt;code&gt;smartctl -v 1,hex48 -v 7,hex48 -A &#x2F;dev&#x2F;hda&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this command, our read and seek error values become &lt;strong&gt;0x&lt;u&gt;0000&lt;&#x2F;u&gt;07cda64f&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;0x&lt;u&gt;0003&lt;&#x2F;u&gt;13f9253e&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; respectively. The first four digits following the x (emphasized) are the total number of errors. As you can see, read and seek errors are only 0 and 3 respectively for this particular drive. And the total number of reads are 130917967 and 335095102 respectively, obtained by taking the last eight digits and converting from hexadecimal to decimal numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On ThinkPads running Windows (and a steadily decreasing number of competitors), the middle mouse button below the TrackPoint can be used as a scroll modifier
for the trackpoint or a middle-click&#x2F;MOUSE3 button, but not both at the same time. Here’s some ways to make it work with both.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a pretty decent workaround with w10wheel that works just about as well as tpmiddle did. Here’s how I do it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download w10wheel and unzip it somewhere.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tenforums.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;57690-create-elevated-shortcut-without-uac-prompt-windows-10-a.html&quot;&gt;this page&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to create a UAC-less shortcut for the program. This will allow the program to run as administrator without having to allow it every time with the User Account Control prompt. You want to run it as admin so you can scroll on things like Task Manager and your clipboard history.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the shortcut into this directory: &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the w10wheel program will be installed (by just unzipping it, there’s no installer) and will launch at startup without an annoying UAC prompt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make w10wheel work just like tpmiddle, I did this:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the trackpoint settings by going to Start-&amp;gt; start typing “mouse settings” -&amp;gt; click on “Mouse settings”.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under “Synaptics Trackpoint” click on &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the &lt;strong&gt;Middle Button Action&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Middle Button&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch w10wheel if it’s not running already.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the w10wheel tray icon.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;Trigger&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;MiddleDrag&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This makes it so that holding down the middle button will allow you to scroll. Setting it to “Middle” makes it a toggle and I don’t recommend that.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that &lt;strong&gt;Horizontal Scroll&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is checked in the same menu.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Set Number&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; menu, set &lt;strong&gt;verticalThreshold&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to 1 and &lt;strong&gt;horizontalThreshold&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to 4. These values are the “resistance” to your mouse movement. It maxes at 500 but really anything past 5 is hard on a trackpoint but YMMV. If you’re gonna adjust it I’d recommend doing it a few ticks at a time.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Enable &lt;strong&gt;Cursor Change&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in the menu. This gives you a visual indicator that you are scrolling. I am yet to find a way to change which cursor type it changes to, unfortunately. I don’t really like the “resize window” cursor it gives you.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
