This site\nhas become something of a playground for me to exercise my CSS skills, and I‚Äôve\ndecided it‚Äôs time to put in writing some of the ideas that have been in my head\nwhile I mess with it.\n#A. Technical\n\nDo much with little: a standard text-only blog page should require &lt;512KB of resources on first load.\nIf it‚Äôs needed to render the page, load it all at once, as quickly as possible. No import chains.\nBut if it‚Äôs not, load it later. Prefer hiding the asynchronous nature, silently degrading until the resource is loaded.\nThe page should gracefully degrade for older/simpler browsers. Specifically, the inline stylesheet should allow for\na pleasant reading experience in even Firefox 3 and the structure should do the same for lynx.\nAvoid loading images where possible.\n\n#B. Aesthetic\n\nEschew corporate ‚Äúflat design‚Äù and reflexive minimalism.\nBorrow elements from different eras of computing history, including 1980s terminals and graphical desktop environments from 1993-2009.\n\nIBM AS/400\n*nixen\nMS-DOS and compatibles\nWindows 3, 95, 98, 2000, XP MCE, Longhorn, Vista\nOS/2 Warp\nApple II series\nMac OS System 7, 8, 9, Rhapsody, Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard\nApple print advertisements\nKDE 3.5\nGNOME 2 from Ubuntu 8.04‚Äì10.10\nWinamp Skins ü¶ô\nMac OS Themes\nXP Themes\n\n\nGradients are underrated.\nNot everything needs rounded corners.\nDepth adds interest and helps the user feel grounded, if it is coherent.\nUse relative colors, such that the page looks good with ANY selected primary color.\nThis isn‚Äôt Neocities: keep styles coherent such that most of the site is obviously in the same design language.\nThis isn‚Äôt Serious Business: a little bit of whimsy doesn‚Äôt hurt\n\n#C. Usability &amp; Accessibility\n\nInteractable elements should be obvious, and their function telegraphed by their appearance.\nHeadings and body text should be readable with a sane size and line width. The font size should follow the user‚Äôs browser defaults.\nImages need alt tags.\nSemantic HTML elements are preferred to &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;\nConsider screen sizes from 350x350 to 4K at standard DPI.\nContrast matters.\nNeither light mode nor dark mode receives preferential treatment.\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://deal.digital/blog/wintricks/","title":"Sick Tricks for making Windows 11 Usable","description":null,"body":"Inspired by Nathan Lineback.\n#Installation\nGet an ISO (consumer editions here). Write it to your install media:\n\nCurrent Windows users: Use Rufus to write it to a flash drive, and ensure that you tell it to remove requirement for an online Microsoft account and disable data collection when prompted.\nAdvanced or Linux users: Install Ventoy to your flash drive. Copy your Windows ISO to it. Build an autounattend.xml with this tool then use VentoyPlugson to point at the XML file on the Autoinstall page.\n\nBoot your flash drive and install to the preferred disk. Activate using your legitimate product key and not, for example, some kind of Microsoft Activation Script you pulled from GitHub :^)\n#Essential software &amp; configuration\nThe first thing you‚Äôll need is a copy of O&amp;O ShutUp10 (or Chris Titus‚Äôs Windows Utility). Go through and disable all telemetry and ads (though you may want to leave some, like location services).\nWindows includes lots of animations that slow you down (start menu, smoother cursor in office applications, smooth Page Up/Down), and they can all be turned off in Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Visual effects &gt; Animation.\nYou‚Äôll need a browser that isn‚Äôt the ad-ridden spyware that is Edge‚Äìtry LibreWolf or Brave with crypto wallet disabled.\nMSEdgeRedirect is a must if you happen to use the built-in Start menu search or weather widgets but don‚Äôt want them to open links in Edge.\n\n#Package Management\nThe quickest way I‚Äôve found to get most software for Windows these days is using WinGet. I can‚Äôt make promises as to exactly how well-moderated the package sources are, but I‚Äôve yet to encounter\ntrue malware within it. Here‚Äôs the commands you‚Äôll wind up using:\n\n#UX Tweaks\nWindhawk will help you reclaim screen real estate by setting taskbar height and icon size to 36 and 20 respectively (pair with button width 32 for best results).\nAltSnap will allow you to drag and snap windows around using the Alt (or if configured, Super) key so that you don‚Äôt have to target the edge of the window just to resize or find the titlebar to move it.

After pronouncing a string of drives defective based on these fields, I did some digging and found that Seagate drives use non-standard formatting for these values. Every piece of disk-monitoring software I had used reports these values incorrectly. Incidentally, this was good for our bottom line at the computer shop where we sold quite a few customers SSD upgrades partly on the basis of these mistaken readings. While the easiest advice on this subject is to ignore these values in the absence of other drive issues, there is a way to read them.\nUpdated 2025: here‚Äôs a calculator someone built to determine these values for you.\n#The Process\nThe vast majority of programs that read SMART data rely on smartctl (Windows download), which we‚Äôll use to read these values.\nAssuming that our disk is located at /dev/hda (which is typical for smartctl on Windows and older Linuxes), we can get the disk status using smartctl -A /dev/hda. The raw read error rate will be reported as something like 130917967 and the seek something like 13219996990. This is clearly wrong, because the drive hasn‚Äôt failed or reported any SMART errors, and the normalized value still shows this attribute to be within acceptable margins.\nThis is because the read and seek error rates are actually recorded as 48-bit hexadecimal values, where the first 16 bits (4 hex digits) represent the total number of read or seek errors and the last 32 bits (8 hex digits) represent the total number of reads or seeks attempted. We can get these values with the command smartctl -v 1,hex48 -v 7,hex48 -A /dev/hda.\nUsing this command, our read and seek error values become 0x000007cda64f and 0x000313f9253e respectively. The first four digits following the x (emphasized) are the total number of errors. As you can see, read and seek errors are only 0 and 3 respectively for this particular drive. And the total number of reads are 130917967 and 335095102 respectively, obtained by taking the last eight digits and converting from hexadecimal to decimal numbers.\n#Additional Reading\n\n\nmy primary source: an article by fzabkar\n\n\na good blog post on the subject by Stjepan Gro≈°\n\n\nthis StackExchange SuperUser question\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://deal.digital/tools/","title":"Tools üõ†Ô∏è","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"https://deal.digital/tools/netlibram/","title":"Dice Roller for Orrex's Net Libram of Random Magical Effects","description":null,"body":"\nScript originally published on my old site, sdx1.net, on 2018-05-29.

Ideally, the DM is supposed to look up the effect based on the player's roll, but I recommend that the DM does the roll if this tool is used.\nFirst things first!\nThis list describes 10,000 Chaos Bursts, which may be thought of as eruptions of disorder resulting from poorly controlled magic use. The reader is encouraged to substitute more a mellifluous term in place of \"Chaos Burst\" if so inclined, but that √≠s what I'm calling them\nWhat's changed in this edition?\nI‚Äôve made an effort to omit references to copyrighted materials, including proprietary spell names. Generic effects such as ‚Äúfireball‚Äù or ‚Äúteleport‚Äù still pop up in the list, but these effects are so commonplace in fantasy that no single source can truly claim ownership of them.\nOver time it occurred to me that version 1.20 includes hundreds of target-affecting Bursts very likely inappropriate and useless to gaming. Too many Bursts affect the target‚Äôs spellbook or his familiar, or they involve subtleties of the target‚Äôs perceptions; I concluded that most Bursts probably won‚Äôt be triggered against magic-using targets, so any Burst that plays upon such a target would miss the mark. Also, since PC‚Äôs don‚Äôt usually have access to an NPC‚Äôs thoughts, it would often be pointless to make the target think that he‚Äôs directly in line for the throne (especially if the target is an orc or troll soon to meet his demise). Better to make the target-affecting Bursts more immediate or visible for the greater enjoyment of the players.\nWriting this edition, I deliberately included a handful of pop-culture references, in-jokes, and a few items of generic commentary. In the whole list there are probably fewer than a dozen, so they shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal during play. They‚Äôre all still playable despite their subject matter, but if they really derail your game, then roll that Burst again.\nWhat hasn't changed?\nMy wit remains just as dazzling, of course, and it shines from every single entry on the list. Beyond that, other features remain basically the same as in the original edition.\nOnce again I have used the pronouns \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his\" throughout the list, but this is intended to save space rather than as a commentary on sex as it pertaisn to chaos bursts. As before, one shouldn't infer a \"boys only\" attitude from this; female spellcasters can unleash chaos just as readily as their male counterparts.\nAnother aspect that is largely the same is the description of area-affecting Bursts; the list still uses the terms \"nearby,\" \"here,\" \"in the area,\" and the like. If a range is not specified, the Gamemaster should assume an arbitrary distance large enough to be interesting but not so large as to be world-shattering. unless otherwise stated, all area-affecting Bursts should be assumed to originate from or center upon the intended spell's intended target point. The terms \"target point\" and \"spell's target point\" are used interchangeably.\nWhy do Chaos Bursts happen?\nSome would suggest that casting a spell is analogous to going to a faucet for a drink of water. A conventional mage is like a normal person. He holds his glass beneath the spigot, turns on the tap, fills his glass to the desired level, and turns off the top. Simple, efficient, and orderly. However, the wild mage doesn't work that way. Instead, he smashes the spigot with a hammer, tries to catch as much water as he wants in his glass, and then tries to reseal the ruptured faucet. Complicated, inefficient, and chaotic. And very likely to get the wild mage soaked in the process. So it is with magic. Instead of opening a precise channel for magical energy, the wild mage tears a gaping hole in reality and hopes to get a paritcular effect. If he can reseal the hole, great. If not, the result is a Chaos Burst.\nWhat happened to the spell I tried to cast?\nIn the previous edition I suggested that the intended spell be allowed to function unless directly contradicted by the Burst. I now feel this approach to be floawed and propsoe an alternative: the chance that a spell succeeds despite a Burst is equal to 10% per caster level minus 5% per level of the spell. Thus a 5th level mage who triggers a Burst when casting fireball has a 10% per caster level minus 5% per level of the spell. Thus a 5th level mage who triggers a Burst when casting fireball has a 35% (that is , (5 x 10) - (3 x 5)) chance to succeed. Otherwise, the spell fails and is lost from memory. Feel free to devise similar methods as you see fit.\nCan conventional mages cause Chaos Bursts?\nSure! In addition to Wild Magic regions, normal mages can cause Bursts if they are disrupted during the casting of a normal spell. Though unlikely at low levels, higher-power spells can wreak havoc if not properly cast. To represent this, consider that a miscast spell has a percent chance equal to the square of one plus its level to cause a Burst. That is, a 1st level spell has a 4% (1+1)2 chance, but a 9th level spell has a 100% (9+1)^2 chance. This can be modified by the mage‚Äôs level or some similar value, as determined by the GM.\nDo I get a Saving Throw?\nThis is up to the GM, but I‚Äôd suggest against it for the most part. Unless the effect or the player‚Äôs resultant griping will fatally disrupt the campaign, let the chips fall where they may. Most Bursts are, after all, reversible, so even the most cantankerous player could be soothed by an interesting quest to remove the Burst‚Äôs effect. Comparatively few Bursts cause instant death, so there is little to fear except inconvenience. If someone is expressly protected against an effect, like bursting into flame, then the Burst can be considered negated.\nThe description didn‚Äôt give a duration. How long does the effect last?\nIn general, if no duration is specified, then a Burst should be considered permanent until dispelled. Alternatively, it may be appropriate for a Burst to persist for as long as the intended spell would have done, or one round per caster level‚Äîwhichever is greater. A third possibility is to roll dice to determine the Burst‚Äôs duration in turns, hours, days, weeks, or whatever. Yet another option is to assume that the Burst will last until some apparently random condition is met, (a brief list of possible conditions is provided at the end of this document). However, if a Burst has an explicit duration, then it should be assumed that nothing short of divine intervention or a full Wish can cancel the effect before that time. Similarly, if a Burst has an instantaneous duration but a permanent effect, such as 1d10 of the target‚Äôs fingers vanishing, then the effect can‚Äôt be Dispelled per se; the target might be Healed, but there is no lingering magical effect to Dispel, so other remedies must be sought. As in the previous edition, any effort to dispel a Burst should be considered at least as difficult as an attempt to dispel magic cast by a mage twice the level of the caster who triggered the Burst.\nAlso, it must be noted that many Bursts produce a beneficial effect in exchange for a heavy price; if the price is negated, then the benefit should also be negated. For example, fit he cater becomes immune to disease by cutting off his thumbs, then he should lose that immunity if his thumbs are restored.\nSome of these are cool, but some are just downright silly. What gives?\nThat‚Äôs how it goes. The list is designed to add interesting elements to role-playing, not simply to blow the caster out of his boots or to turn the target into a puddle of goo. Sure it's nice that the target shrinks to 1/12 his height, but isn't it somehow more satisfying to have the caster think that all other magic users are out to get him? There are, to be sure, a bunch of powerful results, but these are ultimately less entertaining than the good role-playing required by some of the others.\nWhat about Bursts that just don't make sense?\nEffects with invisible or inappropriate results should be kept secret by the GM (at least from the characters) to preserve the mystery and danger of wild magic. If a fish has its feet enlarged or an aerial servant has half of its body turned invisible, the players should be told that nothing seems to happen. Such a statement could as easily mean a red dragon is now stalking the party but is not yet nearby. Likewise, a delayed effect should not be revealed until it occurs; if the caster is to turn into a duck under the next full moon, let him find out when the time comes.\nHow's it arranged?\nIt's still broken into three main categories: those affecting the caster, his possessions, or his allies; those affecting the target, his possessions, or his allies; and those affecting objects or creatures in the surrounding area or the area itself. Also included in that last category are Bursts that implicitly affect neither the caster nor target but which lie in wait for some triggering effect to occur later. In addition, I've added a few really high powered results near the end of the list, and these are at least global in scale.\nThere seems to be some duplication here!\nUpon reviewing version 1.20, I found that duplication was much more widespread than I‚Äôd originally realized, and I felt that this shortchanged the reader. Some will object that the current list still has a lot of thematic repetition; many Bursts involve the target disgorging some unlikely item or the caster befalling an awkward fate the next time he opens a door. Sure, these are broadly repetitive, but each result is sufficiently distinct, in my view, to count as a separate effect. In contrast, I know of at least one gaming system that touts its rulebook to contain over two thousand spells, but upon inspection one finds twenty variations of fireball, of lightning bolt, of polymorph, etc., until the list dwindles to around forty or fifty truly distinct spell effects. With this list, I think the variance is much greater.\nWhat else is this list good for?\nWhile intended for determining Choas Bursts, the table serves equally well in generating the effects of a Wand of Wonder or any similarly chaotic magical disaster. If the rolled BUrst refers to an \"intended spell effect,\" then the GM should determine how this applies, either choosing a spell at random from the character's repertoire or simply rerolling the effect.\nWhat about Gamemaster's option other than that?\nGM's option should be exercised only if a Burst would so imbalance a campaign that it becomes unenjoyable. In an attempt to introduce a real quality of randomness to wild magic, this table presents a broad range of effects. In modifying a die roll in favor of one outcome or another, the Gm runs the risk of excluding randomness from the game. Therefore, I recommend that the resultant effect be used without modification whenver possible. I elaborate on this point a little later.\nAdditional Notes on the Adjudication of Chaos Bursts\nNothing is gained by excessive literalism in interpreting a Burst result; if a Burst calls for the caster‚Äôs waterskin to be filled with squid eggs, but the caster carries a canteen, then by all means make the Burst affect his canteen instead. This isn‚Äôt a blanket justification forarbitrarily zany interpretation of results, but it should make the Bursts more generally applicable.\nCareful handling by the GM still makes all the difference. Many Bursts have no immediately discernible effect; it would be a great loss to the players to reveal the nature of the effect before it is actually manifest in the course of play. For this reason, spells whose primary purpose is to identify a Burst prematurely should be forbidden, or at least tightly constrained. Sure, a full Wish spell might work, but anything less than that should have at best a very low probability of success. The same goes for ‚ÄúDispel Chaos Burst‚Äù or the like; if the whole point of wild magic is to embrace the dangers and benefits of chaos, then where‚Äôs the fun in establishing a bunch of safety nets and escape clauses? Such fail-safes should be avoided. Or let your players try to use them, each time triggering another Burst until they catch on and abandon the pursuit.\nHowever, if you‚Äôre feeling particularly charitable, and if a Burst has an ongoing effect likely to result in a character‚Äôs speedy demise, you might allow the player to roll against the character‚Äôs intelligence to get a sense of what‚Äôs going on. For example, if the character is to lose one hit point per round until he says his name, a successful Intelligence check might inspire him to introduce himself to someone nearby, preferably just moments before it‚Äôs too late! Don‚Äôt apply this method if the Burst‚Äôs effect is simply delayed; it should only be used when a character‚Äôs death is imminent.\nAlong those same lines, if the victim‚Äôs perceptions, alignment, or beliefs are altered, then while they persist the player should proceed as if these alterations are complete and natural for the character. That is, if a Burst causes its victim to believe that his hands are made of candy, then he won‚Äôt want to be convinced otherwise. This is similar to magical alignment changes in the official game; the victim completely adopts the new alignment as if it‚Äôs his true inclination, and he won‚Äôt seek to alter or undo the change.\nThis list sucks even worse than the last one! Who do I bitch to!I received quite a bit of email feedback about the list v1.20, and I‚Äôm grateful to everyone who took the time to contact me. One of the most common criticisms dealt with the inclusion of technologies that, to some people, simply seemed out of place. In this list, I‚Äôve reduced the incidence of anachronistic objects and Bursts in the hope of diminishing that error.Comments and critiques are still welcome, of course.

You want to run it as admin so you can scroll on things like Task Manager and your clipboard history.\nCopy the shortcut into this directory: C:\\Users\\(username)\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\n\nNow the w10wheel program will be installed (by just unzipping it, there‚Äôs no installer) and will launch at startup without an annoying UAC prompt.\nTo make w10wheel work just like tpmiddle, I did this:\n\nGo to the trackpoint settings by going to Start-&gt; start typing ‚Äúmouse settings‚Äù -&gt; click on ‚ÄúMouse settings‚Äù.\nUnder ‚ÄúSynaptics Trackpoint‚Äù click on Settings.\nSet the Middle Button Action to Middle Button.\nLaunch w10wheel if it‚Äôs not running already.\nRight click on the w10wheel tray icon.\nSet Trigger to MiddleDrag. This makes it so that holding down the middle button will allow you to scroll. Setting it to ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù makes it a toggle and I don‚Äôt recommend that.\nMake sure that Horizontal Scroll is checked in the same menu.\nIn the Set Number menu, set verticalThreshold to 1 and horizontalThreshold to 4. These values are the ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to your mouse movement. It maxes at 500 but really anything past 5 is hard on a trackpoint but YMMV. If you‚Äôre gonna adjust it I‚Äôd recommend doing it a few ticks at a time.\nOptional Enable Cursor Change in the menu. This gives you a visual indicator that you are scrolling. I am yet to find a way to change which cursor type it changes to, unfortunately. I don‚Äôt really like the ‚Äúresize window‚Äù cursor it gives you.\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://deal.digital/tools/win11-hta/","title":"Windows 11-styled HTA dialogs","description":null,"body":"Recently, I had to let some users know that we would be replacing their computers as part of a Windows 11\nupgrade.

I don‚Äôt have a dark mode implemented or anything of the sort,\nbut I got as close as I could with the fonts, button, and button pane.
